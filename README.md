# HistogramVideo

Math simulation video about histograms and the histogram equalization algorithm. Created for educational purposes for an audience with no or very little knowledge regarding Computer Vision.
Simulated using High-Level Shader Language (HLSL) utilizing Unity's Compute shaders, as well as animation and programming tools.

This video was created specifically for the Summer of Math Exposition 2 (SoME2) hosted by Grant Sanderson [(3Blue1Brown)](https://www.3blue1brown.com/).

## Video Overview

The video showcases the concepts of histograms and the histogram equalization algorithm through a visually engaging simulation. It provides an intuitive explanation of how histograms work and demonstrates the process of equalizing a histogram using a specific algorithm.

## Technologies Used

The simulation was developed using the following technologies:

- High-Level Shader Language (Hlsl): The video utilizes Hlsl to implement the visual effects and computations necessary for the simulation.
- Unity's Compute Shaders: Compute shaders in Unity were employed to optimize and parallelize the moving textures in the simulations, enhancing the performance.
- Animation and Programming Tools: Various animation and programming tools available in Unity were utilized to create the visual elements and control the simulation.
- The video was edited using DaVinci Resolve.
