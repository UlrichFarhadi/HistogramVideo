# HistogramVideo

Math simulation video regarding histograms and the histogram equalization algorithm. Created for educational purposes for an audience with no or very little knowledge regarding Computer Vision.
Simulated using High-Level Shader Language (Hlsl) utilizing Unity's Compute shaders, as well as animation and programming tools.

The video created is a contribution to the Summer of Math Exposition hosted by Grant Sanderson [(3Blue1Brown)](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)

## Video Overview

The video showcases the concepts of histograms and the histogram equalization algorithm through a visually engaging simulation. It provides an intuitive explanation of how histograms work and demonstrates the process of equalizing a histogram using a specific algorithm.

## Technologies Used

The simulation was developed using the following technologies:

- High-Level Shader Language (Hlsl): The video utilizes Hlsl to implement the visual effects and computations necessary for the simulation.
- Unity's Compute Shaders: Compute shaders in Unity were employed to optimize and parallelize the histogram equalization algorithm, enhancing the performance of the simulation.
- Animation and Programming Tools: Various animation and programming tools available in Unity were utilized to create the visual elements and control the simulation.
